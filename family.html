    <center><b>My Family</b></center></h1>
<center><p>This page is all about my family! My family and I are very close, we do a lot of "family outings." I think that family is one of the most important things
in life. We tend to call ourselves the next "Full House" because of everyone who lives in our house. Right now, it's
my mom, dad, sister, brother-in-law, nephew, and myself. So we really do have a full house!</center></p>

<p>These are my parents, Wendy and Eric! They are two of my biggest cheerleaders for anything that I do, and I am very thankful
for everything that they have done for me, and continue to do for me.</p>

<center><p>This is my sister, Whitney, my brother-in-law, Cam, and my nephew, Grayson! They are also a huge support system for me
with whatever I choose to do. I am extremely blessed to have them in my life.</p></center>

<center><p>Again, this is my nephew, Grayson. He is two and a half and has endured more than most people have, especially for being so young.
On July 27th, 2018, Grayson was diagnosed with ALL B-Cell Leukemia, at just shy of two years old. I feel as though this devastating
news has made our family even closer than we were before. Grayson has just recently fought and earned his title of being "in remission!"
    This little boy is seriously the strongest little super hero there is. Nothing can keep him down, not even cancer!</p></center>
